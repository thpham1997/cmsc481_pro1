b. Brief description of application task and protocol being implemented.
    The application is a note memo application that is hosted on a server, with all communications done over TCP.
    The user can add, delete and view memos from the server using a client app.
c. Summary of your learning
    We learned how to utilize TCP in creating a server and client pair. 
d. Challenges faced in doing the assignment and how did you address it.
    Due to developing the client and server independently, there was an initial issue in testing interactions between both. 
    The issue was resolved through careful debugging and fixing the structural discrepencies between the client and server.


Approximate duration (in days) spent in completing the assignment. 6 days

3. A document (.pdf or Word) providing detailed protocol design and implementation i.e.
messages/requests being sent by the client and corresponding responses from the
server. Provide format details of both request and response.
4. Design FSM for both client and server and work out timeline sequence diagrams
covering various success and error cases. Show timeline sequence diagram fo one
success case and at least 2 error cases
5. Both the client and server programs.
